# GitHubber - Setvi Technical Exercise 

This repository contains the solution to the job interview task given by Setvi for the iOS Developer position.

GitHubber is a compact GitHub client application that offers users the ability to browse through users, repositories, and commits.

## Features

- User list screen: The User List screen displays a list of users. Each user is represented by their username and profile picture. There is a search bar used to search for a specific user.
- Repository list screen: The Repository List screen presents a collection of repositories for selected user as well as details about that user. Each repositoried item contains its name, number of stars, and programming language.
- Commit list screen: The Commit List screen displays a list of commits made to a particular repository. Each commit item contains its message, sha hash, author and commiter.
- Authentication token input screen: The Authentication Token Input screen presents users with a form-based interface designed for entering their personal access token used for authentication purposes. While not mandatory, providing this token enhances the quota limits for accessing the GitHub API.
